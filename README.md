> A React project that builds a photo wall webpage, intended to demonstrate understanding of the following:
>
> - maintaining state in React components
> - making API calls from within a React component
> - implementing asynchronous functions within React hooks
> - iterating over state to dynamically generate DOM elements
> - enabling a "load more" feature for the end user, as an alternative to infinite scroll
> - using CSS styling to create a persistent, "floating" nav bar, as well as a flexbox-based image grid
